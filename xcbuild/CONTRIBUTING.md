xcbuild actively welcomes contributions from the community. If you run into problems, please open an issue. Pull requests are great too!

## Getting Started

To learn about xcbuild, start with the techincal overview below. Each of the components of xcbuild is documented in the `Headers` directory, with both module and API documentation available.

If you're new to xcbuild, we have a [list of issues](https://github.com/facebook/xcbuild/labels/starter) designed for new contributors to get started in the codebase. We're always happy to help people working on these issues and learning about xcbuild.

## Overview

To make xcbuild useful as more than just a build tool, it's built as a collection of libraries. Each of these libraries has its headers under `Headers` and `PrivateHeaders`, source code under `Sources`, and unit tests under `Tests`. Under `Tools` are the executables that use the xcbuild libraries, including `xcbuild` itself.

High level overview of each component library:

 - `ext`: *Standalone.* Standard library extensions from the future.
 - `plist`: *Standalone.* Reader, writer, and model for ASCII, binary, and XML property lists.
 - `ninja`: *Standalone.* Generator for Ninja build files.
 - `dependency`: *Standalone.* Parse dependency info from various tools.
 - `libutil`: Common utilities and platform abstractions.
 - `pbxsetting`: Build setting parsing, levels, and resolution.
 - `xcsdk`: Loads the available platforms, SDKs, and toolchains in a developer root.
 - `pbxspec`: Parses available build settings, tools, and file types into strongly-typed structures.
 - `pbxproj`: Parses project files into strongly-typed structures.
 - `xcworkspace`: Parses workspaces into strongly-typed structures.
 - `xcscheme`: Parses schemes into strongly-typed structures.
 - `builtin`: Built-in tools used for building, like file copying and validation.
 - `pbxbuild`: Performs the build. Made up of a number of subcomponents:
   - `Build`: Top-level context for the scheme, targets, and action for a build.
   - `Target`: Creates the build environment and settings for each target.
   - `Phase`: Implementations for the various build phases (compile, link, copy, etc).
   - `Tool`: Tool implementations for generating command line invocations.
 - `xcformatter`: Build log formatting styles.
 - `xcexecution`: Build execution engines.
 - `xcdriver`: Parses command line options and drives the build.

## Style

C++ can be complex, so xcbuild tries to stick with a reasonable subset modeled after Swift, Rust, and other modern langages. Prefer immutable structures and classes. Prefer passing by const reference, and avoid non-const references. Templates are avoided when possible. Exceptions and RTTI are not used.
